# Week 08 — Portfolio Review & Assessment Preparation

Overview

This week focuses on consolidating the practical work completed across the module into a clear, reproducible portfolio that aligns with the assessment criteria. The portfolio demonstrates technical competency, reflective insight and evidence-based reporting.

## Learning objectives

- Consolidate week-by-week work into a cohesive portfolio.
- Provide clear technical evidence and reproducible steps for exercises.
- Produce reflective commentary explaining decisions and trade-offs.
- Ensure repository structure and documentation meet assessment expectations.

## Conceptual context

Professional cybersecurity reports prioritise clarity, evidence and critical analysis over raw output. Assessors expect well-organised documentation, reproducible steps, and reasoned explanation of choices and limitations.

## Practical activities

- Draft and standardise documentation for each week.
- Harmonise repository file structure and naming conventions.
- Add short reflections that explain intent, methodology and results.
- Include screenshots and annotated outputs to evidence tool usage.
- Add ethical notes and usage constraints where relevant.

## How to view / run the portfolio

Clone or download the repository and browse the weekly folders. Each week's folder contains a `README` with usage notes and dependency information for any scripts or tools.

Example (replace `<repo-url>` with the actual repository URL):

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Week08_PortfolioReview
```


## Submission requirements

- Provide an accessible GitHub link to the repository.
- Submit a ZIP archive of the repository in addition to the online link.
- Declare any AI assistance used during preparation.

## AI assistance

Where AI tools were used (e.g., for drafting text or generating examples), note the tool and the specific assistance provided. This supports academic honesty and reproducibility.

## Reflection

The portfolio review emphasised that demonstrable understanding comes from combining correct implementation with clear explanation and evidence. Documentation that explains why decisions were taken and how results were obtained is essential for professional practice in cybersecurity.
