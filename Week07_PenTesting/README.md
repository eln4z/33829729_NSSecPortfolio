## Overview

This folder contains lightweight reconnaissance scripts used to demonstrate basic enumeration techniques: WHOIS-style lookups, HTTP header inspection, and simple TCP port scanning. These examples are for learning and reporting purposes, not production scanning.

## Files

- `whois_recon.py` — resolves a domain to an IP and fetches organisational/location metadata (uses `ipapi.co`). Defaults to `python.com`.
- `header_scan.py` — performs an HTTP HEAD request and prints common response headers. Defaults to `http://python.com`.
- `port_scanner.py` — connects to a list of TCP ports on a host and reports which are open. Defaults to `127.0.0.1` and ports `[80, 443, 22, 25, 8080]`.
- `screenshots/week07/` — sample outputs and evidence of tool runs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- One third-party package: `requests`

Install the dependency with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Quick usage

Run the scripts directly from the repository root. Each script has sensible defaults (see *Files* above). Example runs:

```bash
python whois_recon.py      # resolves and shows org/country for python.com
python header_scan.py      # prints Server, Content-Type, X-Powered-By for http://python.com
python port_scanner.py     # scans common ports on 127.0.0.1 and prints any open ports
```

To target a different host or range, edit the variables at the bottom of each script (no CLI parsing is currently implemented). If you'd like, I can add `argparse` support so each script accepts `--target`, `--host`, `--ports`, etc.

## How the scripts work (brief)

- `whois_recon.py`: uses `socket.gethostbyname()` to resolve the domain, then calls `https://ipapi.co/<ip>/json/` for organisation and geo metadata.
- `header_scan.py`: issues `requests.head()` and prints header values such as `Server` and `Content-Type`.
- `port_scanner.py`: iterates a list of ports and uses `socket.connect_ex()` with a 1s timeout to detect open ports.

These demonstrations prioritise clarity over efficiency or feature-completeness.

## Ethical & legal notice

Reconnaissance can be intrusive. Only run these tools against systems you own or explicitly have permission to test. Unauthorised scanning may violate laws, terms of service, or institutional policy.

Minimum rules:

- Permission: obtain written permission for any target outside your control.
- Scope: restrict scans to agreed IP ranges and time windows.
- Impact: avoid aggressive or large-scale scans that could disrupt services.
- Privacy: handle any personal or sensitive data responsibly.

## Reflection

Discovery and enumeration are the foundation of security assessments. These lightweight tools show how simple checks (DNS resolution, header inspection, port probes) can quickly reveal useful information — which makes clear why ethical guardrails and careful reporting are essential.
